# Most Common Words
One of my hobbies is language learning. I have found that one of the most effective ways to increase your vocabulary in a new language is to study the top *x* words in the target language.

For example, you may start with the top *100* words, then *300* words, then *500* words, and so on.

There are websites that provide this information, but I thought it would be fun to collect the data myself. This project uses the Python library, `Tweepy`, to collect Tweets from selected Twitter accounts and extract the most common words from those Tweets.
